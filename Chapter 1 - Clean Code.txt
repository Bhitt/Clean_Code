Costs of Bad Code:
	Productivity falls drastically as more messes are made in code.
	Redesigns take a long time and may end up with similar issues.

Primal Conundrum:
	Previous messes slow down developers.
	More messes are made to reach deadlines.
	Deadlines aren't actually hit when making messes most of the time.

Attitude:
	Communication to managers and marketers is very important for succesful code. That involves 
	speaking up in regards to schedules and feasibility. "What if you were a doctor and had a 
	patient who demanded that you stop all the silly handwashing in preparation for surgery because 
	it was taking too much time?"

We Are Authors:
	We are constantly reading old code to write new code.
	Make your code easy to read so that future code is easier to write.

The Boy Scout Rule:
	Check in code cleaner than when you checked it out.
