Small! :
	Write small functions

Blocks and Indenting :
	Blocks within if statements should be one line long. These can call a descriptive function.
	Indent levels of a function should only be one or two (not too nested)

Do One Thing :
	Functions should do one thing
	If you can extract another function from it with a name that is not merely a restatement of its
	implementation, then you probably should break it up.

Switch Statements : 
	See description on page 38. This is a useful clean way to implement switch statements.

Function Arguments : 
	The fewer arguments, the better.
	Arguments can be wrapped in objects to simplify
